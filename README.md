## Purpose

This is the code plug to my Anytone AT-D878UV. I use CPS version 1.12 and firmware 1.12. The main purpose to publish these files online is to make it easy for me to make updates. In case you want to contribute, feel free to make pull request and/or forks from my work.

## What is included?

DMR and FM repeaters in Sweden is included so far. Also D-STAR/FM duo mode repeaters are included in FM mode if I have information they use sub tone on their TX. I will also make individual zones for each Swedish call area.

Added RoamingChannel and RoamingZone files for Sweden.

## Road map

Maybe I will add DMR repeaters in OZ, LA and OH/OH0. Maybe you want to help me?
